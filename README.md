# JSFundamentals Course Description

Come here to solidify your understanding of Objects, Arrays and Functions in JavaScript and learn the common mistakes made by beginners. This is a highly interactive course that uses exercises and projects to drive home these JS Fundamentals. You will finish this course with expert knowledge on one of the most important aspects of the language: objects, arrays and functions. This course is the first of three in the JavaScript Fundamentals series. 

# Course Format

The course is taught over four days with one three-hour workshop held each day. Two of these workshops consist of lectures and exercises that check the understanding of the material. The other two workshops are project-based where the fundamental concepts learned are put to use in independent projects with TAs helping each student at their level. The lectures and projects alternate. This course is the first of three in the JavaScript Fundamentals series.

# Syllabus

Wednesday, May 28th (6pm-9pm) Lecture + Exercise Day 
Topic: Everything you thought you knew about Functions.

Today we will straighten out common confusions related to functions with exercises intertwined.

## Goals of this course

The goal of the JavaScript Fundamentals 1, 2 and 3 - collectively called Hack Reactor Junior (HRJR) classes - is to give technical foundation and support for those who have been learning JavaScript for a couple of months, so that they will have reached a level required for the Hack Reactor admission's interviews.

*IMPORTANT*: completion of the HRJR courses is no guarantee of admission, nor has any influence in the admissions process.

It is our goal, however, that students who successfully complete the HRJR series will have covered all JavaScript topics necessary for the interview.

If Hack Reactor takes people from 60 to 120 in web development, then Hack Reactor Junior takes people from 10 to 60 ('coz we don't teach variables and the like).

## Prerequisites

Students should have 1-2 months experience with JavaScript and programming, about the level of Codecademy. Students should understand and be familiar with variables, if/else statements, for loops and the most basic of JavaScript syntax.

## Textbook

No textbook is required for this course. All materials are included in this github repo.

## Technical requirements

Laptop, Chrome browser and a text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 3 for this course becuase its fast, light weight and you can run your JavaScript files in its console with Node.
